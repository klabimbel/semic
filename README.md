SEMIC
=====

*SEMIC* is a *S*urface *E*nergy and *M*ass Balance of *I*ntermediate *C*omplexity.
It calculates surface temperature and mass balance terms (e.g., accumulation and ablation) over snow- and ice-covered regions, especially over glaciers or large ice sheets.
The model is driven by atmospheric forcing like air temperure, downwelling radiation, wind, humidity and surface pressure.

Example

An example on how to run *SEMIC* is provided in the `example` directory.
